# Diglett 
A PokÃ©mon which dig for repository documentation and detect _potentially_ outdated `README.md`. Diglett is a GitHub action and it checks:
 - When `README.md` was last modified.
 - Who did the last update and wheather the person is still member of the organization.  
 - Number of commits pushed since the `README.md` was last modified.
